See the file COPYING for license information.



Description:
With this plugin you can launch mame-games.
The plugin will start mame under X, but if someone could
reactivate the sdl-dvb-driver, if should work over DVB, too.
Not tested yet.



Installation:
You need VDR (of course!) and sdlmame.
A few roms are welcome, too.
Unpack the sources into your VDR-plugins-directory, and create a
symlink to mame, like the other plugins.
Type make plugins to build the plugin.
Modify the script "vdr-mame-launch.sh" to your needs, and copy it to
your path.
If you want to be able to control mame with your remotecontrol,
modify the file vdr-mame-lircrc to your needs, and copy it to your
lirc-config-directory. Make sure, that it is loaded with
irexec /etc/lirc/vdr-mame-lircrc
Load the plugin with -P mame



Configuration:
At this time, there are only two setup-options:
Stop VDR before play: The VDR will be stopped, before the game
is launched. This is recommended, when using a weak machine or
something like xineliboutput. VDR will be restarted automatically
after mame has ended. Specify the start / stop commands in the
"vdr-mame-launch" script.

Rompath: I think, that explains itself.

the plugin:
